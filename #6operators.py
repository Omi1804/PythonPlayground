# Assignment Operators

x = 10  # The '=' operator assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.

x += 5  # The '+= 'operator adds the value on the right to the variable and assigns the result to the variable.
# Equivalent to: x = x + 5

x -= 3  # The '-=' operator subtracts the value on the right from the variable and assigns the result to the variable.
# Equivalent to: x = x - 3

x /= 2  # The '/=' operator divides the variable by the value on the right and assigns the result to the variable.
# Equivalent to: x = x / 2

x %= 4  # The '%=' operator takes the modulus of the variable by the value on the right and assigns the result to the variable.
# Equivalent to: x = x % 4

x **= 3  # The '**=' operator raises the variable to the power of the value on the right and assigns the result to the variable.
# Equivalent to: x = x ** 3


# Logical Operators

a = True
b = False

not a  # The 'not' operator inverts the boolean value of the variable.
# If a is True, not a is False.

a and b  # The 'and' operator returns True if both variables are True.
# Otherwise, it returns False.

a or b  # The 'or' operator returns True if at least one of the variables is True.
# If both are False, it returns False.
